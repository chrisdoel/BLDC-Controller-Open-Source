For only hall sensor operation:
1x ir2136s
6x mosfets (for cheap high current use IRF3205)
6x 10 Ohm resistor
3x 220nF (This depends heavily on the choice of mosfet and will have to be recalucated if using different mosfets, see bootstrap capacitor calculation image)
2x 0.1uf
1x 0.047uf (can be swapped for another 0.1uf)
1x 2.2M Ohm

For current limitation
2x 2512 3W 1mOhm smd resisitors
741 op amp
1x 10uf
an input and feedback resistor for required gain, for example:
>Voltage drop across the two shunt resistors in parallel at 40 amp is 40*0.0005 = 0.02v
>The ir2316 cuts out when ITRIP exceeds a voltage of 0.5v
>Therefore, if our max current was 40 amp, we want a non inverting gain of 25

Extra components for sensorless operation:
1x 10uf
3x 15k Ohm
6x 100k Ohm
1x LM339N
3x 200pf

You will obviously need an arduino nano
You will need a buck converter module capable of stepping down the input voltage to 12v and ideally able to provide 1 amp
The input is simply a potentiometer, a pulldown resistor with a high value is recommended to prevent noise being registered as throttle input if the throttle is disconnected
